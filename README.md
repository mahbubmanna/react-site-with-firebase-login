## Project Overview

This project is a simple website for a Dental Clinic.

* The Home page will show and highlight the theme and services of the clinic. The Homepage contains grid-cards about all the services and doctors.

* Every grid-cards of the Homepage has a button to redirect the visitors to a page containing detailed information about that particular service or dentist. That means every service or dentist has a dedicated page. 

* Visitors/patients can book for services or doctor's appointments on this redirected page.

* This redirected page asks for login or register if the visitor is not logged in. So, to view details and book an appointment, a patient/viewer needs to log in or register.  

* Booking form asks only for preferred date and time from the patients, and a brief info description of the illness/issue. Hospital staff will examine the data first, then they will make the appointment.
